This is a Supervised Machine Learning project done on Laptop data. The data is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains data of several different factors can affect laptop computer prices obtained from Flipkart.

The aim of this project is to perform feature engineering and clean the data for regression analysis. Thus laptop prices are predicted using different regression techniques like - Linear, Ridge, Lasso.
